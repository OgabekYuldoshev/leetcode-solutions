# 2108. Find First Palindromic String in the Array

# Given an array of strings words, return the first palindromic string in the array. If there is no such string, return an empty string "".

# A string is palindromic if it reads the same forward and backward.


from typing import List


class Solution:
    def firstPalindrome(self, words: List[str]) -> str:
        for word in words:
            if word == word[::-1]:
                return word
        return ""

s = Solution()

print(s.firstPalindrome(["abc","car","ada","racecar","cool"]))

# Input: words = ["abc","car","ada","racecar","cool"]
# Output: "ada"
# Explanation: The first string that is palindromic is "ada".
# Note that "racecar" is also palindromic, but it is not the first
